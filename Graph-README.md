Assumptions:

- A data point is added every minute.
- The most recent point is always displayed despite the stride.
- Once the max display points + 1 is reached, multiply stride by 2, resample old points and add the most recent point. This results in (max display points / 2) + 1 points displayed.
- For the data below
    - New data point added every minute
    - Max display points = 256
    - Stride starts at 1 minute and is multiplied by two every reset

Formula 1: Downsampling Factor (Stride)

factor = max(1, 2^ceil(log2(n / MAX_POINTS))) 
Logic:
- n is the number of data points collected so far.
- MAX_POINTS is the maximum number of points allowed on the graph (e.g. 256).
- We want to reduce the number of points being drawn to stay under the limit.
- The stride (sampling factor) increases as needed in powers of 2: 1, 2, 4, 8, etc.
- The formula ensures we only increase the stride when absolutely necessary, by comparing how many total points we have (n) to how many we can afford to display (MAX_POINTS).


Formula 2: Number of Points Displayed

displayedPoints = floor((n - 1) / factor) + 1 
Logic:
- We treat the most recent data point separately: it's always shown, even if it doesnâ€™t align with the stride.
- The remaining n - 1 points are downsampled by the current stride.
- We take every factorth point from the first n - 1, and then add one more point: the latest one.
